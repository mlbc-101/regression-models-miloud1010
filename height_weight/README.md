# Height Weight Dataset 🏋🏫📚🎓🧘‍

Human Height and Weight are mostly hereditable, but lifestyles, diet, health, and environmental factors also play a role in determining an individual's physical characteristics. The dataset contains 25,000 synthetic records of human heights and weights of 18 years old children. These data were simulated based on a 1993 by a Growth Survey of 25,000 children from birth to 18 years of age recruited from Maternal and Child Health Centres (MCHC) and schools and were used to develop Hong Kong's current growth charts for weight, height, weight-for-age, weight-for-height and body mass index (BMI). See also the Major League Baseball Players Height and Weight dataset.

You will find 3 columns <Index, height, weights>, try to see if there is any missing values, some outliers and so on.

# Objective

We want to predict the weight of the persons given its height, so your task is to create a model that can do this task, a simple linear regression model can do the job.
